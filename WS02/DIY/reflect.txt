This workshop wasn't very challenging for me because the instructions were clear enough to show you how to code the functions in the program from the scratch. Moreover, the part 2 of this workshop was related to the first one, so I basically just copy paste the functions and changed the struct and the member names in the logic. The only challenge that I found is the function bool readBirthDate(int month); because I need to read the birth records matching the month, so I was stuck a little bit until I found out that I had to create two new vraibles int inputMonth, numResult; to use for the for loop. Apart that, everything was mangeable thanks to the support and course notes given to understand for example how to allocate a dynamic memory at the execution or run time, by creating new data-type, for example : details = new Employee[numOfRecords]; (in my part 2 of workshop) and by the end of the code, I need to deallocate it like this : delete[] details;
