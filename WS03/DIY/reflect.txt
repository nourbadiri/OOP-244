In this workshop, I found some difficulties to code the BarChart module especially the two functions of void init(const char* title, int noOfSampels, char fill); and void add(const char* bar_title, int value); I didn't get the point actually because I didn't have much details about it, so I kept having errors. Therefore, after rereading the course material and watching some Youtube videos, I understood that I need to initialize noOfSampels to the size of bars, create and new object and then initialize the chart. I learnt also how to privatize data within the class type in order to specifies that those members are accessible only from member functions. In addition to this, I manage easily the Bar module because most of the functions were treated in the previous workshop, therefore, I had a clear idea how to define them and use them in this workshop such us :  void setEmpty(); and bool isValid() const;
