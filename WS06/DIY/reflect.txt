As far as I'm concerned, this workshop was quite easy for me to handle and run properly and understand why a class with resources like "Basket" in this workshop, requires definitions of constructor, a copy constructor, copy assignment operator and destructor and that they are implicitly-defined by the compiler. Moreover, I understood that the function of Basket(Fruit fruits[], int cnt, double price ); copies data from "m_price" (existing object) to a newly created object "price", meanwhile, the function of operator=(const Basket& copy) copies data from "m_price" (existing object) to an existing created object "copy.m_price". Although the support material that I read from the course, I faced during running time of this workshop (lab and diy), many memory leaks errors that I couldn't understand their reasons. After many tries, I figure out that I wasn't delete[]ing the old memory that "m_fruits" previously points to before reassigning "m_fruits" to point at new memory. This was actually my main leak.
